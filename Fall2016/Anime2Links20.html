	<p>Node area is proportional to Pop. Closer Nodes have more respondents watching both.</p>
	<p>Nodes only included if they have more than a 2% Pop.</p>
	<p>Links have a 20% threshold. This is a relative average.</p>
	<p>Ex. 16.1% of 3-gatsu no Lion watchers watched Ajin 2, while 49.4% of Ajin 2 watchers watch 3-gatsu no Lion. The average of that is over the threshold.</p>
